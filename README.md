# GLAM Digitization Index

This project is an attempt to document statuses of the multitude of digitization projects throughout the globe. We intend to list the institutions, staff, partner organizations, funding details, and embargo periods of these projects to keep a transparent measure of open access to the world's collections in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM).
